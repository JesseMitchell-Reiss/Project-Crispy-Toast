# Working With Git
when working on a new task use `git checkout -b name-of-task-branch`
when there is code to save use `git commit -a -m "name of completed stuff"`
to save to remote fork use `git push origin name-of-branch`
to pull from fork use `git pull origin name-of-branch`
to sync upstream with your fork use `git pull upstream main` `git push origin main`
when done with task create a pull request from a task branch to upstream main
when your code is pulled sync your fork with main
