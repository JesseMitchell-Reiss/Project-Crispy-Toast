We are working on a project for OGPC 15 at Ida B. Wells HS.

# Working With Git
when working on a new task use `git checkout -b name-of-task-branch` <br />
when there is code to save use `git commit -a -m "name of completed stuff"` <br />
to save to remote fork use `git push origin name-of-branch` <br />
to pull from fork use `git pull origin name-of-branch` <br />
to sync upstream with your fork use `git pull upstream main` `git push origin main` <br />
when completed with a task, sync your branch to your origin with `git push origin name-of-branch` <br />
switch to main with `git checkout main` <br />
use `git pull upstream main` and `git push origin main` to sync main with upstream <br />
use `git merge name-of-branch` and resolve any conflicts <br />
create a pull request from your main to upstream
