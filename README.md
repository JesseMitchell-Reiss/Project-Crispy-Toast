# Project-Crispy-Toast
Only for the toastiest floor mats.

We are working on a project for OGPC 15 at Ida B. Wells HS.

# Working With Git
when working on a new task use `git checkout -b name-of-task-branch`
when there is code to save use `git commit -a -m "name of completed stuff"`
to save to remote fork use `git push origin name-of-branch`
to pull from fork use `git pull origin name-of-branch`
to sync upstream with your fork use `git pull upstream main` `git push origin main`
when completed with a task, sync your branch to your origin with `git push origin name-of-branch`
switch to main with `git checkout main`
use `git pull upstream main` and `git push origin main` to sync main with upstream
use `git merge name-of-branch` and resolve any conflicts
create a pull request from your main to upstream
